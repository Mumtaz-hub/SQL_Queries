-- using a subquery in select clause (not recommended)
-- Find all employee details and add remarks to those employees who earn
-- more than the average pay

select *
, (case when salary > ( select avg(salary) from employee
          then 'Higher than average'
          else null
) as remark

--- not the best method, better to use join condition

select *
, (case when salary > avg_sal.sal
          then 'Higher than average'
          else null
) as remark
from employee
cross join (select avg(salary) sal from employee) avg_sal

-- Having clause

-- Find the stores who have sold more units than the average units 
-- sold by all stores

select store_name, sum(quantity)
from sales
group by store_name
having sum(quantity) > ( select avg(quantity) from sales)
