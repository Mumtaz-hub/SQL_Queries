-- display the most expensive product under each category (corresponding to each category)

select *,
first_value(product_name) over(partition by product_category order by price desc) as most_expensive_product 
from product

-- display the least expensive product under each category (corresponding to each category)

select *,
last_value(product_name) 
over(
  partition by product_category order by price desc
  range between unbounded preceding and unbound following
) as lest_expensive_product 
from product

----- Notes 
range between unbounded preceding and Current row -- default it takes this frame clause
range between unbounded preceding and unbound following (here, duplicate data also considered till last row)
rows between unbounded preceding and unbound following
rows between unbounded preceding and current row ( (here, current row considered  as last row)
range between 2 preceding and 2 following  ( consider 2 rows prior to the current row and 2 rows after the current row)


------------- Alternate way to write window functions

select *,
first_value(product_name) 
over w 
as lest_expensive_product 
from product
window w as (partition by product_category order by price desc
  range between unbounded preceding and unbound following)


select *,
last_value(product_name) 
over w 
as lest_expensive_product 
from product
window w as (partition by product_category order by price desc
  range between unbounded preceding and unbound following)
