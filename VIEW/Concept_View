-- view is a database object that is created by using the CREATE VIEW statement
-- view is a virtual table that is created by using the CREATE VIEW statement
-- view is created over an SQL query
-- view does not store any data
-- view is used to simplify the complex SQL queries

-- Rules when using CREATE or REPLACE VIEW
--1. Cannot change column names
--2. Cannot change column data types
--3. Cannot change column order
-- Fetch the order summary

create or replace view vw_order_summary 
as
select o.order_id, o.date, p.product_name, o.quantity, p.price, 
(o.quantity * p.price) - ((o.quantity * p.price) * disc_percent::float/100) as cost
from customer c 
join order_details o on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
join  product p on o.product_id = p.product_id

select *from vw_order_summary;

-- Why we use view?
--1. security : By hiding the query used to generate the view, we can hide the data from the users.
--2. simplify complex queries : sharing a view is better than complex queries, avoid rewriting the same complex queries multipletimes
--3. specific user can see only specific data

create role jones
login
password 'jones123'

grant select on vw_order_summary to jones
