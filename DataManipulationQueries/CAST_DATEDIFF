/*
This query selects the employee ID, first name, last name, hire date, and several calculated columns for all employees who were hired in 2020 
and have a salary greater than $50,000. The calculated columns include the hire date formatted as a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", the number of days 
the employee has been employed, and the number of years the employee has been employed.

The CAST function is used to convert the "hire_date" column to a string in the desired format, 
and the DATEDIFF function is used to calculate the number of days between the current date and the hire date.
